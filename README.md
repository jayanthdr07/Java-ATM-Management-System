🏦 Java ATM Management System (OOP Based)
## 📌 Project Overview

The Java ATM Management System is a console-based application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
It simulates real-world ATM functionality, allowing users to perform secure banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and PIN changes using both card and cardless methods.

This project is ideal for beginners to understand OOP concepts, data structures, and menu-driven program design.
